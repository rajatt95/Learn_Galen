Galen Framework:
---------------
Benefits: 

1) Detailed HTML-reports.
2) Object identification can be done by id, CSS , XPath.
3) Human-readable language with two variants of syntax (basic and advanced Galen Spec Language)

---------------
Limitations: 

1) If xpath changes of any element, then, script'll fail and you'll get nothing in report(Blank Page).
2) Direct Comparison not possible for below conditions: 
	i) Same environment but, with different release verisons (Prod 1.0 over Prod 2.0)
	ii) Different environments (Int2 over Prod)
---------------

Rest, 
	1) what is possible with Galen?
	2) How do we put Assertions?
	3) How to tigger the test script?
	4) How to check the results?

For that, I'm ready with a project created for Demo purpose
(URL: https://www-int2.jetblue.com/customer-assurance 
Programming Language: Java).

We can have a demo for it anytime.

Sheikh, if you want to add/update any point, you can do it.

Use this css spec rarely and wisely.)
